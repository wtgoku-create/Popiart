## MCP Integrations

| MCP Tool | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `text_to_speech` | Generate speech from text with voice selection |
| `speech_to_speech` | Transform voice recordings to different voices |
| `voice_clone` | Create instant voice clones from audio samples |

## Expert vs Novice Shibboleths

| Topic | Novice | Expert |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **TTS quality** | "Any voice works" | Matches voice to brand; considers emotion, pace, style |
| **Voice cloning** | "Upload any audio" | Knows 30s-3min of clean, varied speech needed; single speaker |
| **Loudness** | "Make it loud" | Targets -16 to -19 LUFS for podcasts; -14 for streaming |
| **De-essing** | "Doesn't matter" | Knows sibilance lives at 5-8kHz; frequency-selective compression |
| **Compression** | "Squash it" | Uses 3:1-4:1 for dialogue; slow attack (10-20ms) to preserve transients |
| **High-pass** | "Never use it" | Always HPF at 80-100Hz for voice; removes rumble, plosives |
| **True peak** | "Peak is peak" | Knows intersample peaks exceed 0dBFS; targets -1 dBTP |
| **ElevenLabs models** | "Use default" | `eleven_multilingual_v2` for quality; `eleven_flash_v2_5` for speed |

## Common Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern: Uploading Noisy Audio for Voice Cloning
**What it looks like**: Voice clone from phone recording with background noise, echo
**Why it's wrong**: Clone learns the noise; output has artifacts
**What to do instead**: Use `isolate_audio` first; record in quiet space; provide 1-3 min of varied speech

### Anti-Pattern: Ignoring Loudness Standards
**What it looks like**: Podcast at -6 LUFS, then normalized by platform → crushed dynamics
**Why it's wrong**: Each platform normalizes differently; too loud = distortion, too quiet = inaudible
**What to do instead**: Master to -16 LUFS for podcasts; -14 LUFS for streaming; always check true peak < -1 dBTP

### Anti-Pattern: TTS Without Voice Matching
**What it looks like**: Using default robotic voice for premium product
**Why it's wrong**: Voice IS brand; wrong voice = wrong emotional connection
**What to do instead**: `search_voices` to find matching tone; consider custom clone for brand consistency

### Anti-Pattern: No De-essing on Processed Voice
**What it looks like**: "SSSSibilant" speech after compression and EQ boost
**Why it's wrong**: Compression brings up sibilance; EQ boost at 3-5kHz makes it worse
**What to do instead**: De-ess at 5-8kHz before compression; use frequency-selective compression

### Anti-Pattern: Single Take, No Editing
**What it looks like**: Podcast with 20 "ums", breath sounds, long pauses
**Why it's wrong**: Listeners fatigue; unprofessional; reduces engagement
**What to do instead**: Edit out filler words; gate or manually cut breaths; tighten pacing

## Core Concepts

### ElevenLabs Voice Selection

**Model comparison:**
| Model | Quality | Latency | Languages | Use Case |
|-------|---------|---------|-----------|----------|
| `eleven_multilingual_v2` | Best | Higher | 29 | Production, quality-critical |
| `eleven_flash_v2_5` | Good | Lowest | 32 | Real-time, voice UI |
| `eleven_turbo_v2_5` | Better | Low | 32 | Balanced |

**Voice parameters:**
```python
# Stability: 0-1 (lower = more expressive, higher = more consistent)
# Similarity boost: 0-1 (higher = closer to original voice)
# Style: 0-1 (higher = more exaggerated style)

# For natural speech:
stability = 0.5       # Balanced expression
similarity = 0.75     # Close to voice but natural
style = 0.0           # Neutral (increase for dramatic)
```

### Voice Cloning Best Practices

**Audio requirements:**
- Duration: 1-3 minutes (more = better, diminishing returns after 3min)
- Quality: Clean, no background noise, no reverb
- Content: Varied speech (questions, statements, emotions)
- Format: WAV/MP3, 44.1kHz or higher

**Cloning workflow:**
1. `isolate_audio` to clean source material
2. `voice_clone` with cleaned audio
3. Test with varied prompts
4. Adjust stability/similarity for output quality

### Voice Processing Chain

**Standard voice chain (order matters!):**
```
[Raw Recording]
    ↓
[High-Pass Filter @ 80Hz]  ← Remove rumble, plosives
    ↓
[De-esser @ 5-8kHz]        ← Before compression!
    ↓
[Compressor 3:1, 10ms/100ms] ← Smooth dynamics
    ↓
[EQ: +2dB @ 3kHz presence] ← Clarity boost
    ↓
[Limiter -1 dBTP]          ← Prevent clipping
    ↓
[Loudness Norm -16 LUFS]   ← Target loudness
```

### Loudness Standards

| Platform/Format | Target LUFS | True Peak |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Podcast | -16 to -19 | -1 dBTP |
| Audiobook (ACX) | -18 to -23 RMS | -3 dBFS |
| YouTube | -14 | -1 dBTP |
| Spotify/Apple Music | -14 | -1 dBTP |
| Broadcast (EBU R128) | -23 ±1 | -1 dBTP |

**Measurement:**
- LUFS = Loudness Units Full Scale (integrated)
- True Peak = Maximum level including intersample peaks
- Always measure with K-weighting (ITU-R BS.1770)

### Conversational AI Agents

**ElevenLabs agent configuration:**
```python
create_agent(
    name="Support Agent",
    first_message="Hi, how can I help you today?",
    system_prompt="You are a helpful customer support agent...",
    voice_id="your_voice_id",
    language="en",
    llm="gemini-2.0-flash-001",  # Fast for conversation
    temperature=0.5,
    asr_quality="high",          # Speech recognition quality
    turn_timeout=7,              # Seconds before agent responds
    max_duration_seconds=300     # 5 minute call limit
)
```

**Voice UI considerations:**
- Use fast model (`eleven_flash_v2_5`) for real-time
- Keep responses concise (&lt; 30 seconds)
- Add pauses for natural conversation flow
- Handle interruptions gracefully

## Quick Reference

### Voice Selection Decision Tree
- **Brand/professional content?** → Custom clone or curated voice
- **Real-time/interactive?** → `eleven_flash_v2_5` model
- **Quality-critical?** → `eleven_multilingual_v2` model
- **Multiple languages?** → Check language support per voice

### Processing Decision Tree
- **Voice sounds muddy?** → HPF at 80Hz, boost 3kHz
- **Sibilance harsh?** → De-ess at 5-8kHz
- **Inconsistent volume?** → Compress 3:1, then limit
- **Too quiet?** → Normalize to target LUFS
- **Background noise?** → Use `isolate_audio` first

### Common Settings
```
De-esser: 5-8kHz, -6dB reduction, Q=2
Compressor: 3:1 ratio, -20dB threshold, 10ms attack, 100ms release
EQ presence: +2-3dB shelf at 3kHz
HPF: 80-100Hz, 12dB/oct
Limiter: -1 dBTP ceiling
```

## Working With Speech Disfluencies

### Cluttering vs Stuttering

| Type | Characteristics | ASR Impact |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| **Stuttering** | Repetitions ("I-I-I"), prolongations ("wwwant"), blocks (silent pauses) | Word boundaries confused; repetitions misrecognized |
| **Cluttering** | Irregular rate, collapsed syllables, filler overload, tangential speech | Words merged; rate changes confuse timing |

### ASR Challenges with Disfluent Speech

Most ASR models trained on fluent speech. Disfluencies cause:
- Word boundary detection errors
- Repetitions transcribed literally ("I I I want" vs "I want")
- Collapsed syllables missed entirely
- Timing models confused by irregular pace

### Solutions & Workarounds

**1. Model selection (best to worst for disfluencies):**
- **Whisper large-v3** - Most robust to disfluencies
- **ElevenLabs speech_to_text** - Good with varied speech
- **Google Speech-to-Text** - Decent with enhanced models
- **Fast/lightweight models** - Usually worst

**2. Pre-processing:**
```python
# Normalize speech rate before ASR
# Use librosa to stretch irregular segments toward target rate
import librosa
y, sr = librosa.load("disfluent.wav")
y_stretched = librosa.effects.time_stretch(y, rate=0.9)  # Slow down
```

**3. Post-processing:**
- Remove duplicate words: "I I I want" → "I want"
- Filter common fillers: "um", "uh", "like", "you know"
- Use LLM to clean transcripts while preserving meaning

**4. Fine-tuning Whisper (advanced):**
```python
# Fine-tune on disfluent speech dataset
# Datasets: FluencyBank, UCLASS, SEP-28k (stuttering)
from transformers import WhisperForConditionalGeneration, WhisperProcessor

model = WhisperForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("openai/whisper-large-v3")
# Fine-tune on your speech samples with corrected transcripts
# Training loop with disfluent audio → fluent transcript pairs
```

**5. ElevenLabs voice cloning approach:**
- Clone your voice from fluent segments
- Use TTS for fluent output with your voice
- Great for pre-recorded content, not live

### Accessibility Considerations

- Always provide manual transcript correction option
- Consider hybrid: ASR + human review
- For voice UI: longer timeout, confirmation prompts
- Test with actual users from target population

## Performance Targets

| Operation | Typical Time |
|-----------|--------------|
| TTS (100 words) | 2-5 seconds |
| Voice clone creation | 10-30 seconds |
| Speech-to-speech | 3-8 seconds |
| Transcription (1 min audio) | 5-15 seconds |
| Audio isolation | 5-20 seconds |
